Version 2 (under development) of the *Bladder Cancer Biomarker Evaluation Tool (BC-BET)*.

### Description
Rapid evaluation of candidate diagnostic and prognostic gene expression biomarkers in 13 bladder cancer patient cohorts (N = 1454). BC-BET calculates how strongly a gene's expression is associated with tumor presence (distinguishing tumor from normal samples), tumor grade (distinguishing low- from high-grade tumors), tumor stage (distinguishing non-muscle invasive from muscle invasive samples), and patient outcome (e.g., disease-specific survival) in each cohort. BC-BET also allows for evaluation of methylation biomarkers in 4 cohorts (N = 271 samples), for distinguishing tumor from normal samples, and for expression analysis across 40 commonly used bladder cancer cell lines.
